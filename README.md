# Simple Music Player

## Why?
It's for me to understand Rust a bit more. I admit my codes can be messy at times, so do create a PR if there's an improvement I can make. 

## Current Usage
- Input the path (can be relative) to the music file you want to play the song 
- Use up/down arrow keys or `-` and `=` keys to change the volume (use left shift to change the volume in small increment/decrement)
- Use spacebar to pause/play the song
- Exit with `esc`
