# Simple Music Player

## Why?
It's for me to understand Rust a bit more. I admit my codes can be messy at times, so do create a PR if there's an improvement I can make. 

## Installation

### Windows
You can either download the current [release](https://github.com/Opposite34/simple-music-player/releases), or build it yourself from source.

### Others (build from source)

0. Be sure to have Rust installed (see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
1. `git clone` this repository
2. `cargo run` or `cargo build` depending whether you want to run it immediately or not.
3. Enjoy 

## Current Usage
- Input the path (can be relative) to the music file you want to play the song 
- Use up/down arrow keys or `-` and `=` keys to change the volume (use left shift to change the volume in small increment/decrement)
- Use spacebar to pause/play the song
- Exit with `esc`
